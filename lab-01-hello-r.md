## Exercises

### Exercise 1

``` r
?datasaurus_dozen
```

    ## starting httpd help server ... done

Rows: 1846 Columns: 3

``` r
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset) %>%
  print(13)
```

    ## # A tibble:
    ## #   13 x 2
    ##    dataset   
    ##    <chr>     
    ##  1 away      
    ##  2 bullseye  
    ##  3 circle    
    ##  4 dino      
    ##  5 dots      
    ##  6 h_lines   
    ##  7 high_lines
    ##  8 slant_down
    ##  9 slant_up  
    ## 10 star      
    ## 11 v_lines   
    ## 12 wide_lines
    ## 13 x_shape   
    ## # ... with 1
    ## #   more
    ## #   variable:
    ## #   n <int>

### Exercise 2

First let’s plot the data in the dino dataset:

``` r
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-dino-1.png)<!-- -->

And next calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:
-0.064

``` r
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0645

### Exercise 3

Add code and narrative as needed. Note that the R chunks are labeled
with `plot-star` and `cor-star` to provide spaces to place the code for
plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient. To finish, clean
up the narrative by removing these instructions.

I’m some filler text, you should replace me with more meaningful text…

### Exercise 4

Add code and narrative as needed. Note that two R chunks are given but
they are not labeled. Use the convention from above to name them
appropriately.

### Exercise 5

Add code and narrative as needed.

To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the
letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.
